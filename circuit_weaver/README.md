## The Circuit Weaver

Circuit Weaver is a fork of **[Quirk](http://algassert.com/quirk)**, the awesome drag & drop quantum circuit simulator by Craig Gidney.

We have been simplifying Quirk in the context of developing a quantum computing course for learners; see **[Guides](http://qubits.top/guides.html)** for details.


## How to Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Confirm the build succeeded by opening `out/CircuitWeaver.html` with a web browser.
